# SignatureSigningService
A simple program for signing batches of records

# Getting Started
1. Start a local node

`npx hardhat node`

2. Run the SignatureSigningService.py
3. Choose a batch size
4. SignatureSigningService will generate 100,000 records of random data and begin signing them in batches of the chosen size. The random data is committed to the blockchain as additional hex data.
